# Modern-GAP-GNN

Implemented this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00949">paper</a> with modifications to improve the accuracy/privacy tradeoff. We conducted several experiments to verify our approach and compare it to the original author's. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/ComputationTime/Modern-GAP-GNN/blob/main/Report.pdf">writeup</a> of all the experiments.
