# Modern-GAP-GNN

We tried to implement this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00949">paper</a> with modifications to improve the accuracy/privacy tradeoff. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/ComputationTime/Modern-GAP-GNN/blob/main/Report.pdf">writeup</a> of all the experiments. 

## ðŸ§° Tools


- Machine Learning
- Privacy (Differential Privacy)
